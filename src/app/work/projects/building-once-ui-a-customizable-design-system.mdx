## Overview

Development of a flexible and highly customizable decision making framework using Probabilistic PCA, Gaussian Mixture and Deep Probabilistic models.

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Used a modern approach of multicriteria decision making based on ML algorithms. This approach was synchronized with Deep Probabilistic Models, ensuring training flows were seamless and that decision data remained consistent across the ML models used.
- **Functions Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable python functions using advanced python libraries and frameworks, focusing on accessibility and readability.
- **Customization**: Integrated a customization system that allows easy switching and customization according to the case study, training data, and parameter settings.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation to showcase utilities, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the decision framework is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Tensorflow**: An AI and Machine Learning library used for training and inference of neural networks.
- **Tensorflow Probabilisty**: Python library built on Tensorflow, making it easy to combine probabilistic models and deep learning.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing the need for flexibility with the desire to maintain models' training consistency. The solution involved creating well-defined training setting and establishing clear guidelines for when and how the steps could be customized. Additionally, setting up effective synchronization flows between the classical and modern decision making models was a learning approach that greatly improved the whole process.

## Outcome

The decision framework is now intended to be actively used across multiple projects, leading to faster and informed decision making processes, fewer inconsistencies, and improved collaboration between Decision making and stakeholders. It has become a foundation for scaling our experiences efficiently while ensuring a cohesive collaboration.
