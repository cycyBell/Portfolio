## Abstract
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty, 1977) is a mathematical decision-making framework designed to help decicion makers (DMs) rank or prioritize alternatives, sort information based on multiple criteria via criteria and alternatives pairwise  comparison and decision makers consensus building. A recent advancement, the DS/AHP method, merges Dempster-Shafer theory with AHP, enabling judgments on groups of decision alternatives (DA) while incorporating a measure of uncertainty in the final results. Using the Dempster-Shaper Theory(DST), one can tap into its power of multiple evidence sources combination through the famous Dempter's rule of combination. 

Despite its strengths, DS/AHP lacks a proper and well-defined mathematical structure, making it cumbersome and difficult to manage as the number of criteria and alternatives grows. Plus, evaluating decisions based on multiple, often **conflicting**, criteria can possibly output erroneous results. This study shifts focus toward a modern latent-based approach, blending certain aspects of the classical DS/AHP method and some state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) techniques. However, We first take a helicopter view of the DS/AHP method to provide a high-level overview of DS/AHP to ensure accessibility by abstracting away the more granular and nitty-gritty details in order to keep every reader from getting overwhelmed and confused. This will help you get a better grasp of the intuition underpinning the whole process before transitioning into the Machine Learning paradigm, leveraging Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). The actual study aims to evaluate how these methods perform in terms of **feature extraction, decision-making accuracy, sensitivity to different scenarios and computational efficiency**, ultimately assessing how ML-based approaches offer a viable alternative to the traditional DS/AHP.

## I. Introduction
Decision making processes involving multiple conflicting criteria inevitably requires a systematic and logical information structuring; the consideration of evidence based on several criteria is crucial for handling uncertainty and imprecise information. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of techniques used by decision-makers (DMs), when it comes to choosing the best alternatives (for example, choosing 25 best candidates among 2000 for scholarship awards) subject to multiple criteria, to rank alternatives through pairwise comparisons by assigning weights (usually using the 1-9 Saaty's scale) based on their relative importance. Over time, enhanced AHP methods have been introduced to improve its ability to handle uncertainty and tackle ambiguity in human decisions. One such improvement is Dempster-Shafer AHP (DS/AHP), the method proposed by Malcom Beynon, which incorporates Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) in AHP. This combination allows decision-makers to express degrees of belief over a set of alternatives, rather than forcing them into assigning strict probability to each alternative. By using Dempster's rule of combination, DS/AHP aggregates evidence from multiple sources (DMs), offering a more flexible decision-making framework. 

While DS/AHP offers a better bayesian-extended mechanism for handling uncertainty, its mathematical rigidity hinders scalability, making it difficult for optimizations. More critically, decision-making processes often involve complex and high-dimensional data, which traditional AHP approaches, by entirely relying on expert-defined decisions, may struggle to manipulate effectively. These challenges have led researchers to explore modern, data-driven approaches, particularly in the field of Machine Learning (ML). The work of [Ibrahim Yilmaz, Aylin Adem, Metin DaÄŸdeviren, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X23013385) showcased a ML-integrated multi-criteria decision-making approach based on consensus for selection of energy storage locations.

This study investigates the synergy between the traditional **DS/AHP** and some Machine Learning principles in order to redefine multi-criteria decision-making. The main objective is to utilise the power of PPCA and VAES to capture hidden structures in high-dimensional data and learn intrinsic relationships within the data subject to criteria. By integrating Machine Learning , we aim to go past the barriers set by those traditional settings, potentially improving efficiency, scalability, and decision accuracy through sensitivity analysis. Let's have fun by making informed decisions!

## Prerequisite knowledge
Before moving forward with this study, it's crucial for every reader to kwow that prior necessary background knowledge in some aspects of Mathematiques and Machine learning is required. This section presents an overview of those key concepts (core mathematical formulations and the tools used for their implementations) everyone should wrap one's head around to ensure accessibility and clarity : 

* Tensorflow and Tensorflow probability basics;
* Probability distributions and bayesian inference;
*  Mixture Models & Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) : **soft clusturing**;
* Variational inference;
* The classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) : A **dimensionality reduction** technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving variance. An extended probabilistic version will be used here;
* Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) : a class of **generative models** that encode data into a **latent space** and reconstruct it using a **probabilistic** framework;
* Machine Learning and optimizations ;


Other background understandings are implied but non-negligeable. There is no mention of DST or DS/AHP because the brief overview presented afterwards will be enough to stay synced.
## I. Case of study

### I.1. Problem Statement: Optimizing Scholarship Award Allocation

> **Context**:

A prestigious educational instituion has received an overwhelming number of applications for its annual scholarship program. This year, the foundation aims to award 100 scholarships to exceptionally deserving candidates from a total of 45,000 applicants. The selection process must be rigorous, transparent, and fair, ensuring that the scholarships are allocated to those who best align with the institution's mission, requirements and values.

> **Challenge**:

The overwhelming volume of applications and the complexity of evaluating candidates based on diverse criteria necessitate a strong and efficient decision-making framework. To ensure an equitable distribution of scholarships, the foundation has invited 10 decision-makers, each with expertise in different areas relevant to the scholarship criteria.

> **Objective**:

Develop and implement a multicriteria decision-making algorithm that:

- Evaluates 45,000 scholarship applications based on 12 pre-defined criteria;
- Facilitates the consensus-building process among 10 decision-makers;
- Identifies the 100 most deserving candidates who best satisfy the weighted criteria;
- Provides a clear and justifiable ranking of all applicants;
- Handles potential inconsistencies and conflicts in DMs' evaluations.

> **Criteria**:

The 12 evaluation criteria are as follows:

- Academic Merit: Cumulative GPA;
- Extracurricular Involvement: Participation in organizations, and volunteer activities;
- Leadership Potential;
- Community Impact;
- Innovation and Creativity;
- Financial Need;
- Personal Statement Quality: Clarity, and persuasiveness of the applicant's personal statement;
- Letters of Recommendation;
- Alignment with Foundation's Mission;
- Research Potential;
- Communication Skills;
- Diversity and Inclusion.
